        <p class="chuucopy">Kim Ji-woo (Korean: ÍπÄÏßÄÏö∞; born October 20, 1999), known professionally as Chuu (Korean: Ï∏Ñ), is a South Korean singer and television personality. She is a former member of the girl group Loona and its sub-unit, yyxy. In November 2022, Loona's agency, Blockberry Creative, announced on the official fancafe that Chuu will be expelled from Loona, explaining that "there were reports of abuse of power, such as Chuu‚Äôs abusive language towards our staff, and the investigation has revealed the fact, and the company representative is apologizing and comforting the staff." Chuu has recently been caught up in rumors of power abuse, transfer, and bullying within her company. However, the company refused to reveal evidence concerning the rumors of power abuse to the public.[13] At the end of last year, she filed an application for a provisional injunction against her agency, Blockberry Creative, to suspend the exclusive contract. It was also reported that last April she founded her own company, with herself as the CEO.</p>
