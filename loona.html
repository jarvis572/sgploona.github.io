        <p class="loonaspeech">To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand LOOŒ†Œî yyxy. The concept is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of the old testament, plums, and hair dye- most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer‚Äôs head. There‚Äôs also Gowon‚Äôs nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterization and music video- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Ladies' Code cinematography and butterflies, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity and video editing skills to truly appreciate the depths of these theories, to realise that they‚Äôre not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE and the future of LOOŒ†Œî and KPOP. As a consequence people who dislike Gowon and the rest of LOOŒ†Œî yyxy truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn‚Äôt appreciate, for instance, the humour in Chuu‚Äôs existential catchphrase ‚Äúal al al al al‚Äù which itself is a cryptic reference to LOOŒ†Œî ODD EYE CIRCLE's epic Starlight. I‚Äôm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as BlockBerry Creative's genius wit unfolds itself on their computer screens. What fools.. how I pity them.</p>
